        👋 Hey, this is Samarth. I write words and code.
  </h1>
  <hr>
  <p>I am a journalist, computer programmer, and self-appointed observer of the human condition. This is my home on the Internet. Thank you for dropping by.</p>

  <p>📰 I am focused on building the future of news, journalism and knowledge production in India. The journalistic method is not — and has never been — perfect. But rigorous, fact-based and data-informed reporting, with scientific integrity, can help us understand the impossibly complex world we live in, hold the powerful accountable, and seek the truth. That's the goal of the work I do.</p>

  <p>📍Born and brought up in New Delhi. Now based in Landour (Mussourie), a stunningly beautiful mountain town in the lower Western Himalayas.</p>

  <!-- <p>😎 I want </p> -->

  <p>❤️ Love reading non-fiction, drinking coffee, dancing, exercising (i.e. taking care of my body), and walking leisurely amid trees and hills. Blessed with an addiction to freedom and solitude.</p>

  <p>💡I live for big ideas and small details. Always nerding out on statistics, writing, moral philosophy, epistemology, technology, media and human nature. Enjoy finding cross-disciplinary patterns to make sense of the world.</p>

  <p>👨‍🎓 Spent my undergrad learning the fundamentals of math, engineering and computer science at IIT Kanpur. Worked at a tech startup. Revamped the student magazine. Had a lot of fun. Graduated in 2015. </p>

  <!-- <p> I became a journalist by accident. But I am so glad that accident happened. I love what I do,  </p> -->

  <p>💼 Worked as a reporter with <em>The Hindu</em> and <em>Hindustan Times</em>. In 2018, spent life-changing five months as a reporting fellow with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s investigative team in New York. Left full-time work in January 2019. Freelancing and working independently since.</p>
