    <h3 style="padding-bottom: 0.5em">About me</h3>
    <p align="justify">
        My research interests in the area of surgical robotics are continuum robots, robotic palpation, and haptics for surgical robotics. My work focuses on task-based design and modeling of the tele-surgical robotic systems to aid in determining the best suitable manipulator design for a given task, continuum robots, and robotic assistance for trauma care. I am interested in being involved and keep contributing to the field of surgical robotics.
