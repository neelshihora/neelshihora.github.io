    <p class="show-read-more" align="justify">
        While in the design phase of a robotic system for the procedures performed in surgical confined spaces or hard-to-reach-deep surgical fields, 
        designers can leverage a systematic method to compare the design alternatives for telesurgical manipulators quantitatively. Unlike most of the
        work in the literature, we propose an approach for comparing design alternatives by considering the spurious motions along the length of the 
        manipulator in lieu of existing approaches looking at only the end-effector dexterity measures. We propose a performance measure quantifying 
        these spurious motions while the end-effector executes the application-critical tasks such as suturing and tying a knot. A good manipulator 
        design should yield minimal swept volume along its length portions within the confined space. If informed about these spurious motions, that 
        design would lead to reduced force on the internal organs, reducing the pain and discomfort as well as occurrences of extracorporeal 
        inter-manipulator collisions. To validate the proposed approach, we present two illustrative simulation case studies: (1) two planar rigid 
        link serial robots performing the task of following a desired trajectory and (2) two different architectures of tele-surgical manipulators
        performing the task of passing a circular suture needle under the fulcrum constraints. The results show the applicability of the proposed 
        performance measure in determining the suitability of a particular design alternative for a given task. Although results are promising, 
        using this measure alone for design optimization may compromise overall device dexterity. Therefore, this measure needs to be incorporated 
        into a weighted optimization framework for robot design.

    <p class="show-read-more" align="justify">
        Continuum robots present designers with the challenges of interpreting the geometric conditions that lead to singularity. Unlike
        serial robots, where it is easy to relate Plucker line coordinates to physical locations fixed in each link-attached frame, such 
        geometric understanding is hard to visualize for continuum robots. In this paper, we explore the conditions for the singularity of 
        continuum robots comprised of two and three segments. We derive the conditions for singularity and visualize these singular configurations 
        with their corresponding conditions of singularity. We start the analysis assuming circular curvature, and then we discuss how the same 
        analysis can be extended to non-circular curvature cases. We also define safety regions for singularity that depend on an assumed modal 
        shape variation due to the elastic deflections of these robots. These safety zones can be used to produce designs and path plans that 
        guarantee singularity-free performance despite norm-bounded deflections in configuration space.

    <p><b>Feasibility of Remote Landmark Identification for Cricothyrotomy Using Robotic Palpation</b><br />
    <em>IROS | 2021</em><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9636481"> LINK </a></p>
    <img src="IROS2021_graphical_abstract_GIF.gif" alt="Feasibility of Remote Landmark Identification for Cricothyrotomy Using Robotic Palpation" />   
    <p class="show-read-more" align="justify">
        Cricothyrotomy is a life-saving emergency intervention that secures an alternate airway route after a neck injury or obstruction. The 
        procedure starts with identifying the correct location (the cricothyroid membrane) for creating an incision to insert an endotracheal tube. 
        This location is determined using a combination of visual and palpation cues. Enabling robot-assisted remote cricothyrotomy may extend this
        life-saving procedure to injured soldiers or patients who may not be readily accessible for on-site intervention during searchand-rescue 
        scenarios. As a first step towards achieving this goal, this paper explores the feasibility of palpation-assisted landmark identification 
        for cricothyrotomy. Using a cricothyrotomy training simulator, we explore several alternatives for in-situ remote localization of the 
        cricothyroid membrane. These alternatives include a) unaided telemanipulation, b) telemanipulation with direct force feedback, c) telemanipulation 
        with superimposed motion excitation for on-line stiffness estimation and display, and d) fully autonomous palpation scan initialized based on 
        the user’s understanding of key anatomical landmarks. Using the manually digitized cricothyroid membrane location as ground truth, we compare 
        these four methods for accuracy and repeatability of identifying the landmark for cricothyrotomy, time of completion, and ease of use.
        These preliminary results suggest that the accuracy of remote cricothyrotomy landmark identification is improved when the user is aided with 
        visual and force cues. They also show that, with proper user initialization, landmark identification using remote palpation is feasible - 
        therefore satisfying a key prerequisite for future robotic solutions for remote cricothyrotomy.
