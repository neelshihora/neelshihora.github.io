        I am a full-time roboticist, part-time observant, and flexible-schedule ponderer. This is my home on the Internet and it is under construction right now. For this place, I am consulting <a href="https://www.samarthbansal.com/">Smarth Bansal's</a> interior designer. Thank you for stopping by.

        My research interests in the area of surgical robotics are continuum robots, robotic palpation, and haptics for surgical robotics. My work focuses on task-based design and modeling of the tele-surgical robotic systems to aid in determining the best suitable manipulator design for a given task, continuum robots, and robotic assistance for trauma care. I am interested in being involved and keep contributing to the field of surgical robotics.
